# Auto-generate `/etc/hosts` for HackTheBox machines

Save yourself some tedium on getting started on a new machine by having your `/etc/hosts` ready to go.

## Quickstart

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fx2301/htb_etc_hosts/master/hosts_all.txt | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

To give you an idea of the contents:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fx2301/htb_etc_hosts/master/hosts_all.txt | head -n 10

# === start auto-generated by https://github.com/fx2301/htb_etc_hosts ===

# Easy machines
10.10.10.215    academy.htb          # https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/297
10.10.10.98     access.htb           # https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/156
10.10.10.100    active.htb           # https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/148
10.10.10.187    admirer.htb          # https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/248
10.10.11.107    antique.htb          # https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/400
10.10.10.11     arctic.htb           # https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/9
```

## Setup

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable ../htb_cli
```
^^ note that `htb_cli` wasn't a published repo at the time of writing this documentation. Create an issue on this repo if you want access - thanks!

## Generating

Generate a fully up to date hosts.txt yourself (the code defaults to active machines only):
```
python3 generate.py > hosts_active.txt
```

## Downloading

Use the file you want from the repo (list is a snapshot from 2021-11-09):
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fx2301/htb_etc_hosts/master/hosts_all.txt 
```

## Appending

```
cat hosts_all.txt | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## Caveats

This won't play nice with any dynamically IP addresses that are dynamically assigned by HtB.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome. Even just to keep the list up to date. Please don't include any fuzzed subdomains, though. No spoilers allowed (even for retired machines).
